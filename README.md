# Conway's Game of Life
An optimized implementation of Life with speed controls and loop detection.

Inspired by [Game of life for Pixel by Melvin](https://hatchery.badge.team/projects/game_of_life_pixel),
but written from scratch to teach myself some Python.

* Press Up/Down to change the speed
* Press A to reset to a new random board
* Press Left to toggle the fade effect
